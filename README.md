# Using Azure Blockchain to curb unfettered electoral expenditure

## Motivation

The 2019 Lok Sabha elections are claimed to be the most expensive elections ever held in the world. A staggering Rs 55,000-60,000 crore was spent in the Lok Sabha elections, 2019, according to a study by the Centre for Media Studies (CMS), a not-for-profit multi-disciplinary development research think-tank. A large fraction of this money is procured illegally. According to the commission's seizure report dated May 24, 2019, a total of Rs 3,475 crore worth of cash and other items were confiscated during the elections. This included, Rs 844 crore worth of cash, Rs 304 crore worth of liquor, Rs 1,279 crore worth of drugs/narcotics, Rs 987 crore worth of precious metals (gold, etc.), and other items or freebies worth Rs 60 crore. In this dynamic scenario where the sources of funding of the political parties are diversified, the objectives of accountability and transparency seem to be of great importance.

## The Idea

We plan to use Blockchain Technology to regulate and monitor the flow of money and other assets during the elections in real-time. All the monetary transactions made by the candidates and political parties can be stored in a distributed ledger. The ledger can store the data regarding the organization/individual sending money to the parties/candidates and the amount of money which is being transferred to the political party/candidate in the form of funding. This could reduce the illegal funding of political parties substantially as the source of money can be easily determined which is not easy in the current scenario. Currently, the election commission manually checks the sources of funding of political parties, but with the introduction of blockchain, the same procedure can be automated. A transaction regulation system built on the blockchain can leverage the cryptographically secure, decentralized and immutable nature of the technology to identify and monitor suspicious transactions effectively. For instance, if any political party or candidate withdraws unusually large amounts of money or uses the money for illicit purposes, the transaction can be tracked down easily. 

## Implementation

We plan to deploy an Ethereum network for storing all the transaction details of the candidates and political parties during the period of elections. Details regarding the source, amount and reason for using the money can be instantly updated to the decentralized ledger. Each node on the network would represent stakeholders (Candidates, Political parties, Election Commission, etc.) in the election process. So, any transaction made by the candidates can be easily monitored by all the stakeholders. A smart contract can be drawn up which monitors whether the transactions being made are less than the maximum allowed expenditure for the elections. So, if a candidate uses more than the allowed amount of funds during the elections, the election commission along with all the other stakeholders are immediately informed.
